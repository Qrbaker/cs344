    "I think introspection, literally \"looking inward\", is a nice *idea* but it fails in practice. There are immediate concerns that arise when trying to apply introspection. First is the problem of thinking about thinking *with* the organ that is itself the source of thinking. Its like trying to learn about how a car works by dissassembling it **while you're driving it down the highway**. You can only understand so much by pushing on the pedals and twiddling the knobs.\n",

    "Additionally, we do not have enough of a biomechanical understanding to verify any of the principles we might develop, even if we somehow could magically produce them. Its the problem known as [\"the chinese room\"][1], and has been a point of contention with modern turing test winners. \n",
    "\n",
    "Introspection is valuble as a starting point, but given our current progress in both psychology and computer science, I don't see it coming into view until we've solved the basic stuff. Get the machine to walk like a duck and talk like a duck before we tackle making it believe its a duck.\n",

    "I decided to build a python class that could construct \"worlds\", or collections of cities, based on how the constructor is called. If you call the constructor with the `exact` argument with a value more than 2, it will generate *exactly* the amount of cities requested. If you instead initialize World with `maximum`, the amount of cities will be a random value between 2 (the minimum needed to have a useful set) and the number spesified. If the constructor is called with no arguments, the cities will be a random number between 2 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `city route` variable is a list, initially populated with `0`, which I decided will always be the start and end city. I then randomly mix the remaining cities in, although the random order really doesn't matter. If I did this again, I'd simply tack a 0 onto the `cities` list and use that.\n",
