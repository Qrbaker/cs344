b. Pandas is effectively a *superset* of NymPy, in that it offers extra features not included in NumPy, such as easy graph 
generation. Pandas also automatically adds NaN values to nonexistant indexes, so ML datasets require less sanitization.

c. It may be useful to shuffle a DataFrame to expose different data to other external tools or help with statistical 
sampling.
