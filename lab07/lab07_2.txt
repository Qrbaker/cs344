a.  Categorical Data: Data that is a qualitative label, stored and managed as a string
    Numerical Data: Data that is a *number*, stored and managed as a float or int.
b.
    Task 1:

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.000022,
    steps=700,
    batch_size=2
)

    Task 2:

train_model(
    learning_rate=0.0012,
    steps=500,
    batch_size=500,
    input_feature='longitude'
)

c. The "hyper-parameters" taught in this section are the learning rate, 
steps, and batch size. As for model training, the hyperparameters are 
dependent on the data, so there is not hard rules. Regardless, there are 
some "rules of thumb", such as:

* Training error should quickly decrease, then plateau
* Lower learning rater plus a large number of steps, or a large batch 
size is usually an effective combonation.
