a.
	Task 1:

california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"] = 
california_housing_dataframe["total_rooms"] / 
california_housing_dataframe["population"]

calibration_data = train_model(
    learning_rate=0.03,
    steps=750,
    batch_size=15,
    input_feature="rooms_per_person"
)

	Task 2:

plt.scatter(calibration_data['predictions'], 
calibration_data['targets'], np.random.rand(2), alpha = 0.9)

	Task 3:

clipped_feature = 
california_housing_dataframe["rooms_per_person"].apply(lambda x: min(x, 
4))	

b. Synthetic features can reveal additional correlations not as apparent in the initial data, which 
can help train better models.


c. Outliers are simply data points that are far away from where most of the remaining data exists. 
These are typically ignored or thrown out, as they will skew the model.
