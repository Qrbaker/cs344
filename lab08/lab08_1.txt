		Task 1: minimal_features = ["rooms_per_person", "longitude", "latitude", "median_income"]
				Final RMSE: 112.62 (Better than Google's!)
				
		Task 2: training_examples["dist_from_LA"] = abs(training_examples["latitude"] - 34)
				training_examples["dist_from_SF"] = abs(training_examples["latitude"] - 38)
				Final RMSE: 123.16
