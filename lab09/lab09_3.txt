a. *Exercise 1*:
	i. The cats/dogs datasets are 2000 images taken from a larger 25,000 image set.
	ii. 
	iii. When looking at an example, I noted intermediate representations highlighted lines 
and successively highlighted or discarded certain lines until only a few of them remained -- what 
I assume the model has chosen to be the important features.
b. *Exercise 2*:
	i. Data augmentation is a way to synthesize more training data 
by randomly transforming existing data samples to create new variations.
	ii. history = model.fit_generator(
	    train_generator,
	    steps_per_epoch=120,
	    epochs=35,
	    validation_data=validation_generator,
	    validation_steps=40,
	    verbose=2)
